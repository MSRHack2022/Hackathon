# MSR Virtual Hackathon 2022: Submitting description of projects

Instructions for submitting the description of team projects
of the MSR Hackathon, which will be reviewed by the MSR Hackathon
Program Committee.

## Who can submit

To submit a description of a project, the team should have correct and complete
information in the [teams.md](teams.md) file. The name used in that file should
be mentioned in the paper (see below).

## Deadlines

* January 27: Submission of a description of the team projects (up to two pages) for the submission to the MSR Hackathon track.

* February 28: Notification of the acceptance to MSR Hackathon Track published in the MSR proceedings. The PC will judge submissions based on the clarity of the description, the originality of the idea, the potential impact of the proposed solution, and the sophistication of the artifacts produced during the hackathon.

## Format

All teams should use the official
[“ACM Primary Article Template”, as can be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template page](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).
LaTeX users should use the `sigconf` option, as well as the `review`
(to produce line numbers for easy reference by the reviewers) options.
To that end, the following LaTeX code can be placed at the start of the LaTeX document:

```
\documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}

\acmConference[MSR 2022]
  {MSR '22: Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories}
  {May 23–24, 2022}{Pittsburgh, PA, USA}
```

Papers should include the complete list of authors, which should match the list of
authors in the [teams.md](teams.md) file.

The paper should include, as soon as reasonably possible in the introduction,
the name of the team and a footnote with a link to the repository used by the team
during the hackathon (which should match the content of [teams.md[(teams.md).
It is important that the repository includes a README.md file which clearly
states the name of the team, and a summary of the project. Participants can
include in the repository the information as they want, as long as it helps to understand
the project. As a minimum, they
should include any script, dataset, etc. that may be useful for understanding
the paper and the project. It is recommended that the information in the
repository is good enough for reproducing the paper.

Authors are encouraged to check papers presented as a result of the 
[previous edition of the MSR Hackarhon](https://2021.msrconf.org/track/hackathon?#program)
as examples of accepted papers.

* Paper limit: three pages, including references
