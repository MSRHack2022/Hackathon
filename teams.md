Brief description of the intended research

## GrimoireGitter

Repository: https://github.com/k----n/GrimoireGitter

Participants:

* Kalvin Eng
* Hareem Sahar

**Description of the intended research:**
We intend to replicate the pipeline of this paper: https://softwareprocess.es/pubs/sahar2020JSS-Gitter-Issues.pdf accross more Gitter rooms to analyze how issue reports are discussed.

## MPR

Repository: https://github.com/nirhasabnis/Hackathon

Participants:

* Niranjan Hasabnis

**Description of the intended research:**

Using repository information, including metadata, along with some quality metrics to rank repositories based on quality. Towards that end, I am using Perceval and GitHub REST APIs to extract out necessary information.

**Description of the intended research:**

We are a team of five Master's Computing Science students at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/) and are taking part in this hackathon as part of our *Software Maintenance and Evolution* course.
During this hackathon, we will be taking a closer look at the maintainability and evolution-readiness of the GrimoireLab toolkit.
To do this, we will be using the toolkit itself for analysis - e.g. Perceval for repository metrics, Graal for code metrics, and Kibiter for visualization.
We will use this information in combination with issues experienced by other participants, GrimoireLab developers, and our hands-on findings to determine what components are the least future-proof and refactor those where needed.


## NAP (previously team Natarajan Chidambaram)

Repository: https://github.com/pooya-rostami/Hackathon-21

Participants:

* Pooya Rostami Mazrae
* Natarajan Chidambaram

**Description of the intended research:**

We intend to extend an already existing tool about bot detection in GitHub repositories (Published in DOI: 10.1016/j.jss.2021.110911) and add it as a plugin to the existing grimoirelab tool to expand its functionality. Futher we would like to include some visualization for this specific functionality.

## Magna Carta Libertatum

Repository: https://github.com/Magna-Carta-Libertatum/

Participants:

* [Kaylea Champion](https://github.com/kayleachampion)
* [Wm Salt Hale](https://github.com/altsalt)

**Description of the intended research:**

We propose to extend GrimoireLab as needed in order to support an analysis of software licensing. We seek to extract and organize license data collected from repositories, enrich it with category schemes developed by NGOs concerned with software licensing, and analyze the data longitudinally using both category-driven and text processing techniques.

*Potential research questions:*
* How is license usage changing over time?
* Can we detect dark patterns such as license ratcheting through automated means?


## Team Balloon

Repository: https://github.com/cptanalatriste/team-balloon-msr

Participants:

* Carlos Gavidia-Calderon
* DongGyun Han
* Amel Bennaceur

**Description of the intended research:**

We are examining incentives for integrators to perform pull-requests in open source projects.
To this end, we are using Perceval to extract pull-request information
from GitHub repositories.
Using multivariate time-series analysis, we are looking for factors
that affect the decrease/increase of merged pull-requests per integrator.
